*Source: Anj Chang (2014)* 

###Ingredients:###
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 stick butter
- 2 large eggs
- 3 bananas (really ripe)
- 1 tbsp milk
- 1 tbsp cinnamon
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking powder
- optional (dried fruits and nuts, orange liqueur)

###Instructions###
1. put together dried fruits, nuts chopped ~1/2 cup macerated in orange liqueur while you make the batter
2. cream together sugar, butter, eggs added slowly
3. in another bowl, mash bananas, milk, cinnamon
3. in a third bowl, mix flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder
4. add the bananas to the creamed mixture, stirring slowly
5. add the flour to the wet mixture, stirring slowly until flour disappears
6. fold in the nuts

*Sometimes I get lazy and just mix everything in one bowl, but things do taste better if you separately cream the sugar/butter first*

7. Bake in an oven at 350 F for 1 hour (until done when toothpick comes out)

- 1 cup uncooked oatmeal
- 1/2 cup ground flaxseed + wheat germ (roughly ¼ c of each)
- 2/3 cup coconut flakes (I’ve used both sweetened and unsweetened, I don’t think it matters)
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips (give or take, other meltable chocolate works, too)
- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 1/3 cup honey or maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 c goodies (usually raisins and walnuts, whatever else you want to add)
- 1 Tbsp. chia seeds (optional, I’ve never put it in, but that’s bc I don’t keep them around the house)

Heat honey, PB, and vanilla over a low/medium heat in a medium-sized saucepan. When they are warm and thoroughly mixed, add dry ingredients (oatmeal, coconut, flaxseed, wheat germ). Immediately after removing from heat, add chocolate and raisins (or nuts or whatever). Make sure the mixture is still hot when you do this, because you want some melting of the chocolate. After it is all mixed up, form it into balls or cookies and put them in the freezer or the fridge to harden.
I’ve played around with the order of the ingredients to get the easiest combination to stir. Feel free to keep playing.

I use natural PB (Teddie) and it clearly matters how well mixed the jar is. Using a fresh jar turns out much moister than the bottom of a poorly mixed jar. If it seems too stiff, I have added coconut oil in the heating stage to make the mixture more malleable.

Also note that I’m loose with exact amounts of what I add: sometimes a ton of chocolate, sometimes no coconut, etc. It all works, except you have to watch out for texture.
