Banana Bread
------------
*Source: Anj Chang (2014)* 

### Ingredients

- 1 cup sugar
- 1 stick butter
- 2 large eggs
- 3 bananas (really ripe)
- 1 tbsp milk
- 1 tbsp cinnamon
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking powder
- optional (dried fruits and nuts, orange liqueur)

### Instructions

1. put together dried fruits, nuts chopped ~1/2 cup macerated in orange liqueur while you make the batter
2. cream together sugar, butter, eggs added slowly
3. in another bowl, mash bananas, milk, cinnamon
3. in a third bowl, mix flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder
4. add the bananas to the creamed mixture, stirring slowly
5. add the flour to the wet mixture, stirring slowly until flour disappears
6. fold in the nuts

*Sometimes I get lazy and just mix everything in one bowl, but things do taste better if you separately cream the sugar/butter first*

7. Bake in an oven at 350 F for 1 hour (until done when toothpick comes out)

- 1 cup uncooked oatmeal
- 1/2 cup ground flaxseed + wheat germ (roughly ¼ c of each)
- 2/3 cup coconut flakes (I’ve used both sweetened and unsweetened, I don’t think it matters)
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips (give or take, other meltable chocolate works, too)
- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 1/3 cup honey or maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 c goodies (usually raisins and walnuts, whatever else you want to add)
- 1 Tbsp. chia seeds (optional, I’ve never put it in, but that’s bc I don’t keep them around the house)

Heat honey, PB, and vanilla over a low/medium heat in a medium-sized saucepan. When they are warm and thoroughly mixed, add dry ingredients (oatmeal, coconut, flaxseed, wheat germ). Immediately after removing from heat, add chocolate and raisins (or nuts or whatever). Make sure the mixture is still hot when you do this, because you want some melting of the chocolate. After it is all mixed up, form it into balls or cookies and put them in the freezer or the fridge to harden.
I’ve played around with the order of the ingredients to get the easiest combination to stir. Feel free to keep playing.

I use natural PB (Teddie) and it clearly matters how well mixed the jar is. Using a fresh jar turns out much moister than the bottom of a poorly mixed jar. If it seems too stiff, I have added coconut oil in the heating stage to make the mixture more malleable.

Also note that I’m loose with exact amounts of what I add: sometimes a ton of chocolate, sometimes no coconut, etc. It all works, except you have to watch out for texture.

### Preferment

Get the preferment going by adding 50-60g to 200g all-purpose white flour, 50g whole wheat flour and 200g body-temperature water.

Mix briefly to incorporate, until it forms a rough shaggy loose mixture, and leave covered (mostly airtight) in a warm (75 F) place for 7-8h.

It should rise a bit then collapse as the bubbles burst, since it has not enough gluten chain development to stretch.


### Bulk fermentation

Mix 804g all purpose white flour, 76g mixed whole wheat, rye, and other interesting flours, and 684g body-temperature water with very wet hands (to avoid sticking) in a large tub until fully incorporated. Use one hand to mix, and use another very wet hand to scrape extra dough off fingers. 

Let sit covered (airtight) for 15m to autolyze (hydrate the flour).

Add 250-300g of the preferment and 22g (preferably non-iodized) salt and incorporate with a wet hand, using a "pincer" motion to massage and integrate the ingredients well. Scrape tub bottom to get leftover flour. 

Cover and leave in a warm (75 degree) place for 12-15 hours. After 30-60m, reopen and stretch-and-fold 3-4 times until you feel elasticity building. Repeat at roughly 1.5h and at 2-3h (intervals slowing) by which time you should feel the dough building structure and elasticity and it should remain longer in a springy pile, only slowly relaxing back to fill the bottom of the tub. 

When 12-15h have passed, the dough should have doubled in volume. Left too long or too warm, it can triple, but then it will have been exhausted and overstretched. An incandescent lamp can warm a tub in a small space like a cabinet when it's cold out.

## Shaping loaves

Open lid and lay liberal flour around the edge of the bowl. Sprinkle liberal layer of flour on a large working space, minimum 2ft wide. 

Pour dough onto flour "carpet" and separate it from tub with a well-floured hand. To get a cleaner separation you can throw in more flour as you scrape the bottom with fast hand motions. Make as compact a pile as you can in the center of the work area.

Pour a deep "pathway" of flour across the pile where we'll cut the dough with a scraper or the backside of a big knife. If you're careful you can gently cut through the flour pathway with the sharp side of the blade in a soft rolling/chopping motion but don't damage your table. 

Separate the two halves and fold the edges of one loaf over its sticky exposed surface several times, making a ball. Use flour on hands and bottom of the loaf and "trap" the folded-in edges (we'll call this the seam) under the loaf by turning it upside down. Repeat for second loaf. 

While they sit for a moment, bring out and liberally flour a banneton (or a big bowl or pot which you've lightly oiled the inside of, so the flour will stick to the walls). You could use sesame or poppy seeds instead of flour if you don't mind getting your banneton seedy. 

Carefully place a loaf, seams down as you'd left them on your working surface. Sprinkle a bit of leftover flour over the top and edges. Cover loosely -- I use the tub lid so I can stack them, but a slightly loose plastic bag or a cloth can work -- and store in the fridge for 6-8 hours. You can leave them in the fridge for 12 or more hours if you have to, but 8 is ideal.

## Bake

Set oven to 400-450 degrees (many recipes say 475 but I've found this can burn the bottom) and put a slightly open cast iron or enameled dutch oven inside. Be sure the lid handle is oven-safe, and if there's any oil residue, clean this out with soap because it'll cause the bottom to stick and burn, transferring heat too well. 

After heating up, remove the lid (I have to take out the dutch oven to do this) and put a layer of coarse cornmeal or durum flour or just all-purpose flour in the bottom. Something coarse is good to avoid burning the bottom. 

Carefully place loaf, seam up (so, flipping it from how it was in the banneton) at the center of the pot bottom. Cover with lid (be careful, I always burn myself) and bake for 25 minutes. 

Open and remove lid and bake for another 25-30m, or until top is browning and starting to crisp/burn. The seam will open nicely for a natural look, instead of having to cut the loaf. If you underbake it you can always bake it a little later to finish the crust. 

Set it on a wire rack -- even on a gas burner grill can work, or a flat colander -- it just needs some airflow underneath. Don't cut it open for 30m or more -- the bread is still baking inside!

Once it's completely cool, I store bread in plastic or airtight containers, then rebake or toast it. Much preferable to stale bread. 

Lots of butter.
