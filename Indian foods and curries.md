Chana masala
-----
*source:kiranbot (2014)*
*source 2: [internetz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDWfDUi108U&feature=kp)*

Ingredients:
- 1-2 finely chopped onions
- 1-2 diced tomatoes
- chopped garlic, ginger, chili
- whole garam masala (corriander, cumin, star anise, bay leaf)
- chana masala
  - available at an Indian grocery. Look for something with amchur (dry mango powder) or anardana (pomegranate seed powder), like Badshah.
  - the tanginess of the amchur or anardana is what really makes the dish.
- Large can of garbanzo beans (or soak + pressure cook an equivalent amount)

Instructions:
1. Heat some oil and add the cumin and whole garam masala. Let the spices brown.
2. Add the finely chopped onion. Let the onion brown -- don't keep stirring it, Kiran!
3. Add the chili, garlic, and ginger. Add a pinch of powdered garam masala and ~2 spoons of the channa masala powder. Mix. You'll see the onions starting to really fall apart now.
4. Add the diced tomatoes. Let them cook until the oil starts to bubble up around the edges. Be patient -- the oil bubbling is how you know your spices are perfectly cooked and the tomato is totally mushy.
5. Add the channa. Let that cook for however long. Mash up some of the channa with a spoon -- this will add some thickness to the gravy.
6. If you're feeling fancy, garnish with cilantro.

Sambar
-------

*Source: Kiranbot (2013)*

Ingredients and Instructions:
1. wash and soak the pappu (dal). Pressure cook it (2-3 whistles, for kandhi pappu, 1-2 for pesara pappu).

 - 1-1/2 cups Dal (pappu in Telugu), use either. Kandhi pappu is preferred. 
 - pesara pappu (moong dal): small, pale yellow, cooks quickly. doesn't really work for sambar. I think it makes a killer tomato dal, though.
 - kandhi pappu (toor dal): bigger, rich yellow. traditional sambhar/rasam dal.

2. Soak a ball of tamarind in water (about 1-2 cubic inches). To do this quickly: microwave the tamarind in enough water to cover it, and squish it out with your hand. Strain the resulting stuff through a tea strainer or something, unless you like seeds and fiber stuck in your teeth.

3. Heat a bunch of butter or a high heat oil in a pan. (1-3 tsp). Let it melt. Add a pinch or two of mustard seeds. Wait for them to start popping all over the place, then add about a pinch or two  each of (in order!):
--  senaga pappu (chana dal, there's a huge container by the window). add minapappu (urad dal) if you have it. stir for a second.
--  menthulu (methi/fenugreek, this is the stuff you like)
-- dried red chilies (cheat with crushed red pepper if you don't have whole ones)
-- once the senaga pappu looks toasted, add cumin

4. add vegetables. I like okra or carrot especially.

5. add sambar powder. stir and fry the vegetables in the powder.

6. add the tamarind and a bit of water. let come to a boil, lower the heat, then simmer.

7. add the cooked dal, and let simmer.

revisions:
-- microwave tamarind for 20s to quick soak.
-- tomatoes go in with vegetables. about 1-2 roma, or 1 large one.
also julienned onions with the sliced tomatoes.

How to make Kadai Paneer:

1. Grind the onion along with the green chillies. Heat oil and fry this paste for 2-3 mins.

2. Then add the chilli powder, turmeric, jeera, coriander powder and crushed ginger and garlic (or ginger garlic paste) and mix well, frying for another minute.
 
3. To this, add the tomato paste..
 
4. .. and pureed tomato. Fry for 4-5 minutes until the mixture comes together and the oil begins to separate.
 
5. Next add the capsicum..
 
6. .. and kasoori methi, with some salt. Fry for 2-3 mins, until the bell pepper is cooked but still crunchy.
 
7. Finally add the cubed paneer and mix gently until well combined. Simmer for 2 mins and remove from fire.

Garnish with coriander leaves and serve hot with rotis/chapatis.

*I didn't fry the paneer in advance or do the whole dipping in water, squeezing and draining routine because I am very happy adding it as is at the end of this particular dish.*
