Tapas
=====

Champiñones al ajillo (garlic mushrooms) 
---------------------------------------

There are not many tapas recipes more Spanish than this. Gorgeous mushrooms infused with the exotic flavors of spices, olive oil, garlic and Spanish Sherry. 

Serves 4.

Ingredients
- 50ml (2 fl.oz) olive oil 

- 250g (8 oz) mushrooms, sliced or quartered (cremini’s or baby bellas)

- 4-6 cloves garlic, sliced, chopped or minced to taste 

- 3 tablespoons dry sherry (I will bring)

- 2 tablespoons lemon juice 

- large pinch of dried chili flakes (I will bring)

- large pinch of pimenton (paprika) (I will bring)

- Salt and freshly-ground black pepper 

- handful of chopped parsley, to garnish 

Directions:

1. Heat the oil in a frying pan or skillet and fry the mushrooms over high heat for 2 to 

2. 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Lower the heat to medium and add the garlic, lemon juice, sherry, salt and pepper. 

	*For a milder flavor you can leave it at that if you like. But if you like a bit of 'fireworks', now's the time to add the dried chili and paprika as well.*

3. Cook for another 5 minutes or so until the garlic and mushrooms have softened then remove from the heat, sprinkle with chopped parsley and divide up into pre-heated 'little dishes'.

4. Serve with plenty of fresh, crusty bread to mop up those seriously-garlicky juices.
